# your-first-game
My first game created by following the "Your first game" tutorial from [godotengine-docs.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs) I thought it would be a good idea to "make it my own" before continuing with the docs so I swapped out all the music and art with assets of my own creation. I fixed a bug that was present in the tutorial (and reported that bug to the docs team), changed out the player animation for something worse but it was my idea and it worked so it stays and I played around with the messages that get displayed on the title screen and on respawn.

I'd say it was worth it to go back and redo the game with custom assets. This contains my first song, my first sound effect, my first animation and my first game. When I had finished the tutorial I didn't know how anything worked and now I know how 80% of the game works. I decided to do all this in one day and I'm regretting it so I'm going to wrap this up with some credits:
